Please only spend maximum of 4 hours working on it.

We don’t expect everyone to complete everything in the time, so use it as a chance to show how you prioritise the tasks needed doing. Think of this as an opportunity to show us what you can do. If there is anything you can’t do, or run out of time to do, just comment in placeholders to mention why it’s left out.

· Browser requirements are desktop IE11+, latest versions of Webkit. Please let us know which browser you’ve used to develop in (e.g. Chrome/Firefox)
· This site is responsive with a minimum size of 320px and at least should support iPad portrait and landscape.
· Unfortunately, the designer hasn’t done mobile designs and would like you to recommend the solution directly in the HTML so they can review it after you’ve built it.
· JS functionality (you can use jQuery as well if you like):
· The designer has requested a carousel. The animation can be chosen by you and it should also work on mobile
· Large images without captions will have a modal window that displays the caption on click of the image.
· Please annotate anywhere you think there might be accessibility issues and how you might get around them.
· If you're using SASS/SCSS/LESS, please include your construction files as well as the output HTML.

Comment frequently to talk us through what you’ve done – just like you’d normally do when writing code.

Above all, as mentioned above - we're not expecting a completed masterpiece. We're looking for your attention to detail, semantic goodness, and to see how you tackle different problems.  When you’re finished, please send me a git/dropbox/FTP link (if you just ZIP the files our mail server will block your email).
